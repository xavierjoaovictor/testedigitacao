            The actual amount of range that you experience will vary based
            on your particular use conditions. See how particular use conditions
            may affect your range in our simulation model.

            Vehicle range may vary depending on the vehicle configuration,
            battery age and condition, driving style and operating, environmental
            and climate conditions.
